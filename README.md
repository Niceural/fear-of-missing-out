The purpose of this decentralized application is to allow a Funder to create an auction where participants can purchase tickets. A price and a relative deadline are set by the Funder. When the deadline is reached, the winner is set to be the last person to buy a ticket.

## Problem Analysis

This application involves two participants: the Funder, who creates the auction, and a Buyer, who purchases a ticket. The Funder provides the ticket price and the relative deadline to the application. The Funder does not learn anything throughout the execution of the program. The Buyer starts off by knowing nothing and learns the ticket price and deadline during the program execution. The Buyer who sends the last transaction wins the entire balance.
